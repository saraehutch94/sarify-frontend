# Sarify | MERN-stack application

**Sarify** is a MERN-stack application, with data sourced from the Sarify Heroku API. This application is a music streaming application, currently with no music for the purpose of royalties and legalities. A dream of mine is to create my own music streaming service one day. The data rendered in this MERN-stack application, plus the look and feel, is a representation of that dream, minus the music (soon to come).
